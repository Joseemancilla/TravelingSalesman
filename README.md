# Traveling Salesman
 
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of locations and returns to the starting point. 
# Implementation of Solution 

Implement a representation for the input data, such as a list of city objects with longitude and latitude coordinates.
Implement a function to calculate the distance between two cities.
Research and select one or more algorithms for solving the TSP. This could include heuristic algorithms such as the nearest neighbor algorithm or the 2-opt algorithm, as well as exact algorithms such as branch and bound or the dynamic programming approach.
Implement the selected algorithm(s) in Python.
Test the algorithm(s) on a set of sample inputs to evaluate their performance.
Compare the performance of the different algorithms and determine which is the most effective for solving the TSP.
